Spacebook was inspired by my search for the simplest possible way to spin up the simplest possible website in the least amount of time, with the freedom to extend as needed, zero cost, no maintenance burden, and virtually zero effort. Eleventy was a perfect fit, and I spent many hours researching these and other starter projects for ideas and inspiration: 

* [Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowiczi -- I used this as the basis for Netlify CMS integration and for overall code structure
* [Eleventy-Tailwind-AlpineJS Starter](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter) by Greg Wolanski -- this was the method I followed for integrating Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
* [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone) by Zach Leatherman and the Eleventy team -- I used this as an "official" reference even though spacebooks do not contain blog functionality
* [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) by Shu Ding -- this is a Next.js project that also uses Tailwind and heavily inspired the overall design of spacebook. 

Overall I investigated more than a dozen additional [Eleventy starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) for inspiration, code snippets, and to learn more about how Eleventy works. There is no one "right way" to build an Eleventy site an this is just one small attempt.
