The beautiful thing about Eleventy+Github+Netlify is that deploying changes to your site could not be any easier. 

* **If you are editing your files directly on Github** your site is building each time you save a commit to your main branch. Depending on the amount of pages your site has it usually takes 60 seconds or less to complete a deploy. 
* **If you are editing your files locally** your site will automatically build every time you push changes or accept a pull request into your main Github branch. Again it usually takes around 60 seconds or less unless your is very large. 
* **If you are using Netlify CMS** your site builds each time you click the "publish" button. 

That's it! ü§ó
