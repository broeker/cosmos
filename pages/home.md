Cosmos is starter project you can use to spin up a simple website exactly like this one. It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) for site generation, [Tailwind 2.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-based theming, and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for a lightweight JavaScript engine. You can host your site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), with automated [Github](https://www.github.com) deployments and an optional [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) integration. Cosmos is designed to be:

* **Easy to use** 😀 -- drop in a new page and it appears magically in your navigation 
* **Writing focused** 📔 -- clean pages and a simple blog with tags and multiple authors
* **Lightning fast** 🚀 -- static files, system fonts, minimal JavaScript, purge and minify All the Things 
* **Easy on the eyes** 👀 -- a minimalist design and beautiful typography that lets your content shine
* **Accessible** ❤️  -- fully responsive, SEO friendly, and accessible to all
* **Markdown and Emoji friendly** 🦔 -- support for footnotes, custom containers, anchors, and emoji!
* **Flexible** 💪 -- disable features you don't need, add advanced features with serverless functions or Apline.js


Cosmos is named in honor of the great communicator [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) and his ability to explain complex ideas and complicated scenarios like the _entire universe_ with simple words and illustrations. You can use Cosmos for documentation sites, developer blogs, to sketch out new ideas, or for whatever suits your fancy.  

##  “Out of chaos, find simplicity.” -- Bruce Lee 🥋 

Cosmos was inspired by my search for the simplest possible way to stand up the simplest possible website in the least amount of time, with the freedom to extend as needed, zero cost, no maintenance burden, and virtually zero effort. Here is where I landed: 

* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) for a super fast Node-based static site generator that stays out of your way and lets you ship only what you want to ship 🚀
* [Tailwind 2.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a brilliant and tiny utility-first CSS framework. Cosmos (along with sites much more complicated than this one) was created without a single line of CSS  🎨
* [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) a minimal framework for simple or advanced JavaScript. It is the Tailwind of JavaScript with a utility-based approach requiring zero lines of Javascript. 🕹️
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for one-click installs, free hosting, and a [Github](https://github.com/) deployment pipepline 🤖
* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlify.com/) (optional) to provide an easy Markdown editor for creating and changing content 💻

Cosmos was built to satisfy a very particular desire for creating simple, notebook-like websites at the click of a button. If you wish, you may customize Cosmos or use it as the basis for your creating your own starter. There are also dozens of other [Eleventy starters](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that may better meet your specific needs or tastes.

## Coming someday ⛅

* Better image handling
* More advanced code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Dark mode support (via Tailwind 2.0)
* A bit more use of Alpine.js
* e.g. smooth scroll to top, smoother header animation
* Better support for nested pages/hierarchical menus

This is a running list of features I'd like to add someday...✨


## Credits

Recently I was working on a complex technical discovery project, and was seeking a way to replace a jumbled mess of Google docs, Basecamp posts, wireframes, diagrams, and other content into a simple website. After all, the web was literally invented as a method to explain ideas and share complicated documents across a network of 17,000 scientists in more than 100 countries. 

Cosmos is based on my experience researching more than a dozen existing starter kits to become familiar with Eleventy and to discover any common best practices and techniques. The following were especially valuable in my learning journey:

* [Eleventy-Tailwind-AlpineJS Starter](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter) by Greg Wolanski
* [Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowicz

Many starter kits are much more ambitious than this one, which is designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible while still allowing for some more fancy features in the future (Alpine.js) and providing an easy way for non-technical users to create and edit content (Netlify CMS). My thanks to Zach Leatherman and the Eleventy community for this platform and its wide variety of applications. Onward!
