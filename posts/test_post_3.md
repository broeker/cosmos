title: Let's put a touch more of the magic here

summary:  We'll paint one happy little tree right here. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.

Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Every day I learn. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Every day I learn. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

## This isn't a rule

Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?

With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.

There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.
