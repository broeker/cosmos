summary: Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other
  kind. Learn when to stop. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just
  sneaking around and having fun. There we go. And just raise cain. See. We take
  the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Only think about one
  thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Learn when to stop. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. There we go. And just raise cain. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Just make a decision and let it go. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.

Poor old tree. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. At home you have unlimited time. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. What the devil. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.
