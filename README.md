# Cosmos

Cosmos is a simple starter kit based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) that allows you to easily spin up and maintain a new site exactly like this one, hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) with automated [Github](https://www.github.com) deployments. Cosmos is designed to be:

* **Easy to use** 😀 -- drop in a new page and it appears automatically in your navigation 
* **Writing focused** 📔 -- clean pages and a simple blog with tags and multiple authors
* **Lightning fast** 🚀 -- static files, minimal JavaScript, purge and minify All the Things 
* **Easy on the eyes** 👀 -- a minimalist design and beautiful typography that lets your content shine
* **Accessible** ❤️  -- fully responsive, SEO friendly, and accessible to all
* **Markdown and Emoji friendly** 🦔 -- support for footnotes, custom containers, anchors, and emoji!
* **Flexible** 💪 -- disable features you don't need (like contact forms or blogs), or add new features like Netlify serverless functions

You can use Cosmos for simple documentation sites, developer blogs, to sketch out a new idea, or for whatever suits your fancy. Cosmos is named in honor of the great communicator [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) and his ability to explain complex ideas clearly through words and illustrations.
